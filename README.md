# Lazy Rename

A Blender Plugin created to help in the asset creation process for the [Lazy Builder Library](https://github.com/wafflesgama/LazyBuilderLibrary)

This blender plugin automatically renames the selected object (mesh name & object name) based on the **ItemId** & **ItemTypeId** fields. 

It also can rename the parent collection based also on the **ItemId** & **ItemTypeId** fields

The **ItemId** & **ItemTypeId** fields are stored for each object, allowing for quick further changes without requiring to rewrite them.
